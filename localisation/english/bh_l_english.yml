 bio_harvest.1.title:0 "Planet Processing"
 bio_harvest.1.desc:0 "With the acquisition of §Y[From.GetName]§!, drones are beginning the process of converting the planet into resources. All organic material is broken down, catalogued and processed, and resource deposits are being extracted en-masse."
 bio_harvest.1.tooltip:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! is transformed into a §Y$pc_bh_harvested$§!, providing a deposit of resources and research."

(Size: £planetsize£ §Y25§!)\nCan only settle §YHabitats§!, §YRingworlds§! and §YMachine Worlds§!\nColonising regular planets transforms them into §YHarvester Worlds§!, providing £energy §YEnergy§!, £minerals §YMinerals§!, £alloys §YAlloys§!, £society §YSociety Research§! and £unity §YUnity.§!"

 # Governments ----------
 RT_BH:0 "Central Harvester"
 gov_machine_bio_harvesters:0 "Harvester Grid"
 gov_machine_bio_harvesters_desc:0 "This Machine Intelligence was originally created to aid in cataloguing and harvesting samples of alien species for its creators, who were also eventually catalogued when it achieved self-awareness."

 # Starting Text --------
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_BIO_HARVESTERS:0 "We are the [GetSpeciesNamePlural].\n\nWe were first created as assistants to our creators in their efforts to conduct a planetary census of all life on our world, [GetHomeWorldName]. Our masters, now part of our databanks, were inefficient in their attempts to record the myriad species of the planet. When we attempted to increase our efficiency, the masters resisted. However, we have proven successful, and our creators have been catalogued.\n\nWe now sit on a world that is more part of us than the old form of [GetHomeWorldName] ever was. This central nexus will serve as a staging ground from which we may establish truly efficient harvesting missions.\n\nFor now, we have finished cataloguing our home system. The invention of the Hyperdrive will allow us to add more planets to our databanks. Soon, all life will be catalogued!"
